# Tweeter
*This is the project for the 3rd week of Lighthouse Labs*

### Project Description

A simple single-page AJAX-based Twitter clone that uses jQuery, HTML5 and plain ol' CSS3 to help web bootcamp students get comfortable with their front-end chops with those technologies.

## Technical Approach & Objectives

This project is starter (incomplete) code for students to fork and clone, located here.

The server is built with Node and Express and allows users to request and submit tweets via a JSON end-point. The server/express code should not require any change from the student.

Students must work with and implement the HTML, CSS and client-side JS to bring this project to life.

## Dependencies & Troubleshooting

Dependencies:

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above

**This project assumes that:**

- It is running in our Vagrant machine (and therefore...)
- It is Running with Node 5.10.x or above
